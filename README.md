# json-pad
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/json-pad

Google Code is shutting down due to the popularity of GitHub, so I recently exported this project here to preserve the codebase.
My hope is to eventually re-platform this excellent tool on [NW.js - formerly known as Node Webkit](http://nwjs.io/) (rather than Adobe AIR) so that it will run as a
cross-platform compatible GUI. But this effort will have to wait until [__JSON at Work__](https://github.com/tmarrs/json-at-work/blob/master/README.md) is published.
