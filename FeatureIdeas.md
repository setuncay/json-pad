# Small Ideas #
  1. Format/Compress Button for XML conversion
  1. Statusbar for XML editor
  1. Load JSON String by URL

# Big Ideas #
  * **Tabbed Editor**
> A feature for opening "more" json strings. Tabbing the whole editor could be an idea. Every new tab a new instance of the editor.
.

  * **Compare 2 JSON strings**
> With the tab feature we could make it possible to compare two strings in an extra tab (like at netbeans).
.

  * **XML Validator**
> XML validation (http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp)
.

  * **csv2json and back**
> Existing ruby script: http://github.com/darwin/csv2json/tree/0436af721f5c46e0f7491d4b73df4d6a0e016e51 Based on this it would be wonderful getting a js script
.

  * **JSONpath**
> If you know XPath you know what JSONpath is... http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/ A filter method inside the tree would be nice i think
.

  * **JsonML**
> JSON Markup Language. Could be nice if you can use it in the editor. Maybe as conversion or better as second accepted json syntax format. but than i need a parser and a syntax-highlight-parser too. http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-jsonml/ http://jsonml.org/
